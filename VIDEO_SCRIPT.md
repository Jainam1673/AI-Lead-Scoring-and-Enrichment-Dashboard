## üìù Video Production Tips

### Equipment & Setup
- **Screen recording**: Use OBS Studio or Loom
- **Microphone**: Clear audio is crucial (built-in mic OK, but external is better)
- **Lighting**: Face camera if showing yourself, ensure good lighting
- **Background**: Clean, professional (or use virtual background)

### Recording Strategy
- **Practice run**: Do 2-3 dry runs to nail timing
- **Backup recordings**: Record 3 versions, pick the best
- **Screen preparation**: 
  - Close unnecessary tabs/windows
  - Hide notifications
  - Use full-screen mode for dashboard
  - Prepare sample data in advance

### Editing
- **Trim dead air**: Keep it tight, no pauses > 2 seconds
- **Add captions**: Improves accessibility and professionalism
- **Highlight key points**: Use zoom-in or arrows to emphasize
- **Add transitions**: Smooth cuts between sections
- **Background music**: Subtle, professional (or none)
