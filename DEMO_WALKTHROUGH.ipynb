    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "**SaaSQuatchLeads** scrapes thousands of leads, but then what? Sales teams face:\n",
    "- ❌ Hours spent manually qualifying leads\n",
    "- ❌ No prioritization - which leads to call first?\n",
    "- ❌ Missing data - invalid emails, incomplete profiles\n",
    "- ❌ No actionable insights - just raw contact information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Solution\n",
    "**AI-powered post-scraping intelligence layer** that:\n",
    "- ✅ **Scores** leads 0-100 based on decision-making authority\n",
    "- ✅ **Enriches** data with company size, industry, LinkedIn URLs\n",
    "- ✅ **Validates** email formats, removes duplicates\n",
    "- ✅ **Prioritizes** visually with color-coded scores\n",
    "- ✅ **Exports** to CRM systems in one click\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differentiator\n",
    "**We don't replicate scraping** - we solve the critical next step that SaaSQuatchLeads doesn't address."
