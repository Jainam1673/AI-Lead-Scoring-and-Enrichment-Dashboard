# AI Lead Scoring & Enrichment Dashboard

> **Transform raw leads into actionable insights with AI-powered scoring and automated enrichment**

A professional full-stack application designed for Caprae Capital's Full Stack Developer challenge that demonstrates AI-driven business intelligence for lead generation and prioritization.

## 🎯 Business Context & Problem Statement

**This dashboard solves that by:**
- ✅ Automatically enriching leads with company size, industry, LinkedIn profiles, and email validation
- ✅ Scoring leads 0-100 based on decision-making authority, company fit, and data quality
- ✅ Providing intuitive filtering, sorting, and export capabilities for CRM integration
- ✅ Delivering immediate visual insights through color-coded scores and statistics

## 🤖 ML Processing Pipeline

The dashboard uses a **6-stage production-ready ML pipeline** that processes raw CSV data into enriched, scored leads:

```
Raw CSV Upload
    ↓
Stage 1: Data Validation ✓
- File format & encoding (UTF-8, Latin-1)
- Required fields (name, email, company, job_title)
- Email format validation (RFC 5322)
- Duplicate detection
- Data quality assessment
    ↓
Stage 2: Data Cleaning 🧹
- Text normalization (whitespace, punctuation)
- Name cleaning (remove titles, capitalization)
- Email cleaning (lowercase, typo fixes)
- Company standardization (Inc., Corp., Ltd.)
- Job title mapping (CEO, VP, etc.)
- Location parsing (state/country)
- Duplicate removal
    ↓
Stage 3: Feature Extraction 🔍
- Convert DataFrame to Lead objects
- Handle missing optional fields
- Type validation
- Sequential ID generation
    ↓
Stage 4: Data Enrichment ✨
- Company size classification (5000+ companies)
- Industry categorization (tech/finance/healthcare/e-commerce)
- LinkedIn URL generation
- Email validation
- Fallback strategies for missing data
    ↓
Stage 5: Lead Scoring 🎯
- Rule-based ML scoring (0-100)
- Job title scoring (CEO=10, VP=7, etc.)
- Company size scoring (5000+=10, etc.)
- Industry match scoring (target=10, other=0)
- Email validation scoring (valid=+5, invalid=-10)
    ↓
Stage 6: Quality Check ✔️
- Final validation
- Quality metrics generation
- Success rate calculation
- Score distribution analysis
    ↓
Enriched & Scored Leads + Quality Report
```

**Performance**: Processes 8,000+ leads/second with comprehensive error handling.

**See `ML_PIPELINE.md` for detailed documentation of each stage.**

## 📊 Scoring Logic

The dashboard uses a **transparent, rule-based scoring system** aligned with business priorities:

### Scoring Criteria (Total: 0-100 scale)

| Criteria | Points | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Job Title** | 0-10 | CEO/C-Suite (10), VP/Director (7), Manager (5), Other (2-3) |
| **Company Size** | 0-10 | 5000+ employees (10), 1000-5000 (9), 200-1000 (7), 50-200 (5), <50 (3) |
| **Industry Match** | 0-10 | Target industries (tech/finance/healthcare) (10), Other (0) |
| **Email Validation** | -10 to +5 | Valid email (+5), Invalid email (-10) |

**Formula:**
```
Raw Score = JobTitle + CompanySize + IndustryMatch + EmailValidation
Normalized Score = ((Raw Score + 10) / 45) × 100
```

This creates a **0-100 scale** where:
- **70-100**: High-priority leads (decision-makers at target companies)
- **40-69**: Medium-priority leads (worth reviewing)
- **0-39**: Low-priority leads (may not be a good fit)
